# ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) Introduction

ELMo ("Embeddings from Language Model") is a word embedding method for representing a sequence of words as a corresponding sequence of vectors. Character-level tokens are taken as the inputs to a bi-directional LSTM which produces word-level embeddings. Like BERT (but unlike the word embeddings produced by "Bag of Words" approaches, and earlier vector approaches such as Word2Vec and GloVe), ELMo embeddings are context-sensitive, producing different representations for words that share the same spelling but have different meanings (homonyms) \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELMo), n.d.). ELMo embeddings are also task-specific, meaning that the same word can have different embeddings for different tasks. For example, the word "bank" in "river bank" may have a different embedding for a language model trained on a corpus of financial documents than for a language model trained on a corpus of news articles.

The key innovation of ELMo is that it uses a deep, bi-directional neural network to generate a representation for each word in a sentence that is sensitive to the context in which the word appears. This means that the same word can have different representations depending on the context in which it appears.

ELMo is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data, and the resulting embeddings can be used as features for downstream natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation.

One of the advantages of ELMo is that it can capture both syntactic and semantic information in the text, making it well-suited for a variety of NLP tasks. Additionally, because it is pre-trained on a large dataset, it can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets with good results, making it a useful tool for researchers and practitioners alike.
