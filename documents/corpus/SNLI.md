# The Standford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus

Natural Language Inference (NLI), also known as Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE), is the task of determining the inference relation between two (short, ordered) texts: entailment, contradiction, or neutral (MacCartney and Manning 2008).

The Corpus
The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus (version 1.0) is a collection of 570k human-written English sentence pairs manually labeled for balanced classification with the labels entailment, contradiction, and neutral. We aim for it to serve both as a benchmark for evaluating representational systems for text, especially including those induced by representation-learning methods, as well as a resource for developing NLP models of any kind.
